# Unit Testing using QUnit
To view the testing results, it is enough to run the `./qunit.html` file.

Using node, it can be run through `npm test` as shown in `../package.json` with running `java -jar ../selenium-server-standalone-3.13.0.jar` prior to it.

To do so `./run-driver.js` includes: 
* `Selenium-Webdriver` with `chromeDriver`
* `WebdriverIO` with `PhantomJS`
