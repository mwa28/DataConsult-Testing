# Testing Tools Evaluation
Testing Modules for [msp.dcgroup.com](https//msp.dcgroudp.com) using different tools.

## Main QUnit Testing
The HTML file [qunit.html] can be loaded immediately to a browser or starting [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/qunit.html) after starting the server using `npm test`. in order to view testing results. 

It executes tests from [test/test.js] using the [qunit](qunitjs.com) framework.

These tests will be refactored and reconfigured using different tools on different branches to create a full testing tree.
